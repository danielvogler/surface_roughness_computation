# DATA STRUCTURE

1. make sure that there are always **two files for each fracture** present (filename_a.stl and filename_b.stl)
	--> /scripts/createASideCopy.sh can be used for this.

2. Place all fracture surfaces in the **respective subfolders in SURFACE_PATH** ("/path/to/scan/data", see COMPUTING SURFACE ROUGHNESS)


# COMPUTING SURFACE ROUGHNESS

1. update "**Make.local.defs.username**" according to preferences of user "username"
	**CONFIG_FILE_PATH**=/path/to/store/config/files

	**SURFACE_PATH**=/path/to/scan/data

	**SURFACE_CLASSES**= surface_class_1 surface_class_2 surface_class_3
	---> make sure that the *.stl files **start with exactly the same string** 
		as the folder they are located within, 
		which needs to be named surface_class_1 exactly.

	**scLabel** = surface class 1 label, surface class 2 label, surface class 3 label
	---> labels as you want them to appear on plots

	**scAbbreviation** = SC1, SC2, SC3
	---> abbreviations of surface classes. can be used on plots or for saving files.

	**scMarker** = ms1, ms2, ms3
	---> marker symbols for individual surface classes on plots (e.g., "o, o, s")

	**scColor** = scc1, scc2, scc3
	---> colors for individual surface classes in plots (e.g., b, r, lightgrey)

	**FIG_FILE_PATH**=/path/to/store/figures/
	---> note "/" at the end - in contrast to other paths

2. 	```sh 
	make
	```
	---> **Initialize code**. Create PythonConfig files with 1st run of "make" (-jN optional)

3.	```sh
	make
	```
	---> **Run code** with 2nd run of "make"

4.	---> individual scripts run can be found in "MakefileSingle.c"


# PLOTTING

Files for plotting results can be found in "**/pythonPlots/**".
Results will be stored in "**/figures/**".

1. 	```sh
	python plotRoughness.py
	```
	---> runs roughness plots. 
        
2. 	```sh
	python plot1cmTPCFs.py
	```
	---> runs two point correlation function results on 1cm x 1cm surfaces
	
3. 	```sh
	python tpcfCartoon.py
	```
	---> Example figure of two-point correlation functions
