###
### DATA STRUCTURE
###
(1.1) make sure that there are always two files for each fracture present (filename_a.stl and filename_b.stl)
	--> /scripts/createASideCopy.sh can be used for this.

(1.2) Place all fracture surfaces in the respective subfolders in SURFACE_PATH ("/path/to/scan/data", see 2.1)


###
### COMPUTING SURFACE ROUGHNESS
###
(2.1) update Make.local.defs.username according to preferences of user "username"
	CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/path/to/store/config/files

	SURFACE_PATH=/path/to/scan/data

	SURFACE_CLASSES= surface_class_1 surface_class_2 surface_class_3
	---> make sure that the *.stl files start with exactly the same string 
		as the folder they are located within, 
		which needs to be named surface_class_1 exactly.

	scLabel = surface class 1 label, surface class 2 label, surface class 3 label
	---> labels as you want them to appear on plots

	scAbbreviation = SC1, SC2, SC3
	---> abbreviations of surface classes. can be used on plots or for saving files.

	scMarker = ms1, ms2, ms3
	---> marker symbols for individual surface classes on plots (e.g., "o, o, s")

	scColor = scc1, scc2, scc3
	---> colors for individual surface classes in plots (e.g., b, r, lightgrey)

	FIG_FILE_PATH=/path/to/store/figures/
	---> note "/" at the end - in contrast to other paths

(2.2) 	make
	---> create PythonConfig files with 1st run of "make" (-jN, with N as your thread number)

(2.3)	make
	---> run all computations with 2nd run of "make"

(2.4)	---> individual scripts run can be found in "MakefileSingle.c"


###
### PLOTTING
###
(3.1) ---> files for plotting results can be found in "pythonPlots"

(3.2) python plotRoughness.py
      ---> runs roughness plots. 
        
(3.3) python plot1cmTPCFs.py
      ---> runs two point correlation function results on 1cm x 1cm surfaces
